WHACK-A-MOLE - A Game to play for fun and stress

The practice of trying to stop problems, etc., that repeatedly occur in an apparently random manner; also, the act of dealing with such matters in a piecemeal manner without achieving a complete solution. This term is based on a metaphor where an arcade game called Whack-A-Mole invites players to hit a series of pop-up animals with a mallet. A typical Whack-A-Mole machine consists of a waist-level cabinet with a play area and display screen, and a large, soft, black mallet. Six holes in the play area top are filled with small, plastic, cartoonish moles, which pop up at random. Points are scored by, as the name suggests, whacking each mole as it appears.
